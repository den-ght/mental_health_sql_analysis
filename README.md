# üß† Mental Health of International Students ‚Äî SQL Analysis Project

This project explores the mental health of international students using SQL inside a Jupyter Notebook. The dataset comes from a Japanese university survey conducted in 2018 and aims to understand how international status and length of stay impact depression, social connectedness, and acculturative stress.

| `inter_dom`     | Type of student (`Inter` or `Dom`)                        |
| `japanese_cate` | Japanese language proficiency                             |
| `english_cate`  | English language proficiency                              |
| `academic`      | Current academic level (`Undergraduate`, `Graduate`)      |
| `age`           | Age of the student                                        |

| `todep`         | Depression score (PHQ-9 test)                             |
| `tosc`          | Social connectedness score (SCS test)                     |
| `toas`          | Acculturative stress score (ASISS test)                   |

## üéØ Project Goal

To use SQL queries to:
- Compare mental health metrics between international students based on years of stay.
- Identify whether longer stay reduces depression or improves social connectedness.
- Practice working with PostgreSQL using real-world mental health data.

This project was originally inspired by a DataCamp DataLab challenge (2024). All SQL code was written independently and executed in a local Jupyter Notebook environment.

## üß™ SQL Query Example

```sql
SELECT stay,
       COUNT(inter_dom) AS count_int,
       ROUND(AVG(todep), 2) AS avg_depression,
       ROUND(AVG(tosc), 2) AS avg_social_connection,
       ROUND(AVG(toas), 2) AS avg_stress
FROM students
WHERE inter_dom = 'Inter'
GROUP BY stay
ORDER BY stay;
```
